                Nestled in a small New England town is a powerhouse of a ballet school. Its genesis includes the dramatic story of a prima ballerina defecting from the Soviet Union, her tenuous climb to personal and artistic freedom. In a story revealed in dance studio mirrors, Alexandra, a graduate of the prestigious Vaganova Academy and a driven ballerina is leading a diverse group of ballet students in their difficult journey to become professional dancers.

                    <h5> "I believe in cinematic intoxication, when the story transforms into art and allows me and my audience to escape"</h5>
                    
                        <p style="font-size:14px; color:black; padding:2%"> My films are about people, their emotional journeys and personal transformations. One of the most beautiful aspects of our lives is meeting interesting
                        people, listening to their stories, and learning from the experience. I use a cinematic approach to filmmaking, hoping to bring a unique feeling to these
                        stories.
                    
                    <p style="font-size:14px; color:black; padding:2%">
                        The attempt to present stories as art, is at the core of what filmmaking is for me. Ordinary methods don't impress me. I believe in cinematic
                        intoxication, when the story transforms into art and allows me and my audience to escape.  This visual world, which I create with cinematography, sound,
                        and music, is an important part of how I tell the story, hopefully, allowing my audience to experience the story in a personal manner.  Art relies on the
                        dynamic, unifying quality of the human mind, which is why each of my films leave something to the imagination.
                   <br>
                        I choose my structures and visual styles to create a feeling, a mood, and engage the viewer.
                        Currently, I work in a form that is both art and documentary, an aesthetic alliance between 
                        a cinema-verite and a poetic mode of representation. I
                        often search for free and expressive ways to communicate beyond an orderly and typical arrangement of 
                        shots. Often, I experiment in developing a
                        connection through a juxtaposition of isolated sequences and shots that would give more meaning to the film and allow scenes to breathe on their own,
                        without infusing explanation, personal point of view, or direct manipulation.
                   
                    <br>
                        My documentary camerawork portrays reality in a way that attempts to uncover the life present within a human mind, the emotion, simply to find a fragment
                        of a momentary truth.  In opposition to my documentaries, surrealism is 
                        the basis for my short narrative films.  Dreams embrace the visual, aural, and
                        erotic forms within my narrative work, which freely exploits many experimental elements to tell a story symbolically.  I am always seeking alternatives
                        to the linearity of narrative construction. 
                        In my short narrative films I let reality and imagination merge into a visceral, cinematically beautiful
                        experience
