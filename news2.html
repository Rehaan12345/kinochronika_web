            This is the mantra that adorns the wall of Koltun Ballet School Studio as students, ages 14-17, prepare for class. The instructor is xxxx, a 
            former principa ballerina of the Boston ballet and now the owner of one of the top ballet schools in the country. She teaches as she was taught in
            her homeland, Russia, with technical precision and a firm hand. As the mantra implies, there is much hard work expected of her students.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The film will follow six students through a year of intensive training and many long days. They are fiercely determined and struggle through the 
        pain, sweat, and tears to reach their goals. They are driven, but, by who? Is it the parents, who sacrifice their time and money to give their children 
        a chance to be a dancer, a chance to pursue their dreams… or, is it the teacher, who drives the students to accept nothing less than perfection in their
        performance? The film will unfold in this exploration of what it takes to be a ballet dancer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Leave your assumptions at the door, Ballet is not the property of the privileged here. Students come from all backgrounds; there is no preference 
            given; only hard work and discipline will define those who will survive the 4 years of training. As a teacher, Alexandra Koltun is definitely “old 
            school” as she instructs in a burst of temperament. Does it intimidate, embarrass, or instill fear of failure… or does it create a desire deep 
            within the soul of her students, a desire to succeed. The students accept this slave mentality; they learn because they must; failure is not an 
            option; and only those who truly love dance may endure. Each student has sacrifices something of their adolescent life… the company of friends, or
            having time with family to reach a goal. And each experiences or will find the rewards in their own way.

            Is it all worth it? This documentary search for the answer to this question but, in any way, we can’t help cheering for them, and
            we can’t help loving their indomitable spirit
