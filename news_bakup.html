Short synopsis:
Fiercely determined dance students struggle through pain, sweat, and tears to reach perfection within their art.  
They say they love ballet, but what does “love” mean to them?  
The answer lays in each unique journey as they are driven by their passion to sacrifice many of the simple joys of youth in search of the pure beauty of effortless motion.
 
 <br />  <br />
<p><b>Treatment</b></p>
<p>This is the mantra that adorns the walls of private Ballet School studio as students, ages 14-18, prepare for class.  
The instructor is a former principal ballerina of the Boston Ballet and now the owner of one of the top ballet schools 
in the country.  She teaches as she was taught in her homeland, Russia, with technical precision and a firm hand. 
As the adorning epigram implies, there is much hard work expected of her students.

The film will follow several students through a year of intensive training and many long days. 
They are fiercely determined and struggle through the pain, sweat, and tears to reach their goals. 
They say they love ballet, but what does love mean to them?  They are driven, but, by whom?  
Is it the parents, who sacrifice their time and money to give their children a chance to be a dancer, 
a chance to pursue their dreams… or, is it the teacher, who drives the students to accept nothing less than perfection in their performance, or, is it the children’s innate belief in their talents that makes them so passionate about the dance?  
 </p>
        

        <p>Leave your assumptions at the door, Ballet is not the property of the privileged here.  
Students come from all backgrounds and religions; there is no preference given; only hard work and discipline 
will define those who will survive the last four years of training.  As a teacher, Alexandra is definitely “old school” 
as she creates a desire to succeed.  The students learn because failure is not an option; and only those who truly love dance may endure.
Each student has sacrificed something of their adolescent life, the company of friends, time with family, to reach a goal.
 What gives them this strength and discipline to forgo the joys of childhood and adolescent life for this goal?
 The film is an honest and insightful look into their life.
<br />
Is it all worth it? How much can you give for something you truly love?  
They seek these answers, each in their own unique way, and we can’t help cheering for them, we can’t help loving their indomitable spirit.
